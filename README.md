# Indian Road Analytics Project

## Overview
The Indian Road Analytics project is a comprehensive study on road accidents in India, aimed at enhancing road safety through pattern identification. This project explores the influence of various factors such as environmental conditions, demographic aspects, and vehicular variables on road accidents.

## Team Contributions
This project is a collaborative effort, with each member contributing to different aspects such as model implementation, data analysis, and report writing. The contribution percentages are detailed in the report.

## Methodology
The methodology encompasses:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to analyze the data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed significant insights into the geographic, demographic, and vehicular factors affecting road accident severity in India. This includes the impact of the driver's education and experience, as well as road and environmental conditions.

## Suggestions
Based on our findings, we propose several recommendations to improve road safety in India. These suggestions are aimed at policy makers, traffic authorities, and the general public.
